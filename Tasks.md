# Redis
1. Design a relational data model for an online retailer.
2. Transform the data model to Redis data structures.
3. Enter a sufficient amount of sensible data into the Redis data structures.
- Sufficient means: enough to perform some interesting actions with the data, which are typical for an online retailer.
- Data may be entered by hand or by commands MULTI â€¦ EXEC (see tutorial) or by scripts using your preferred scripting or programming language.
4. Write scripts for some of the interesting actions, e.g.
- Adding new customers
- Adding new orders
- Listing all orders of a customer
- Giving statistics about the number of orders of articles
